<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ntokozo Xaba a student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, I am currently pursuing a BSc in Biological Sciences and majoring in Environmental Sciences and Animal Behaviour.I grew up in a township called Soweto in Orlando East as the first daughter and lived an average township girl life,finished my matric in 2019 when I was 17 and was accepted into the institution of my choice because I actually surprisingly performed well in my subjects.
  so I went to Wits as a first year enrolled in a BSc in Computer Sciences even though I had zero computer literacy thus zero motivation or inspiration behind my degree choice, I chose it because I was told to do so as it was "the most in demand qualification" and I would make "a lot of money from it", this adivice came from my peers and family. So I went to school and that is when Covid hit. 
  I had to go back home and I lived in a small rusty shack with my mother and 2 of my siblings with no wifi or money for data I did not have the mental health nor resources to keep up to date with my work and so I failed.
   That and the fact that due to my computer illteracy, I was taking 5x more time to understand concepts that were seemingly revision for 98% of my classmates who went to private schools. The next year, I had given up hope and was afraid of further failure and felt depressed and suicidal, I decided I would be changing my degree to my current one as biology had always been my favourite subject. 
   Afterall, I initially applied to either be a doctor or a physiotherapist buut could not get an letter of attendance. 
</p>

<p>And so I have been pursuing this degree until I heard about Web development, do not get me wrong, I enjoyed Computer Science and loved learning new concepts but it was extremely hard at University level and my situation. 
  I felt stupid and unworthy, the heartbreak I experienced in that same year made things worse for me and I really felt unworthy. So to get out of that dark place I changed.
I am not evolving and have found a passion for coding, I am pursuing a certificate on Udemy as a Web developer and the journey has been fun,challenging and mostly fruitful.
I love it!
</p>

<p> In any case, I hope this journey shows me how hard working I am and how willing I am to get out of my comfort zone and use what I have to show my strengths and grow. I hope being a Web developer challenges me and expands my cognition so that I think outside of the box.
  I hope to help people achieve their business dreams by creating websites that radiate success!, I hope to make a chnage in my life and in the lives of many.
  My portfolio is a reflection of my ups and downs, weaknesses and strengths but mostly my hardwork, I apply myself in every project included here.
  Some took days, some were easy, I cried over others and thought about giving up but in the end, I achieved all of them by myself.
  I hope you enjoy.
